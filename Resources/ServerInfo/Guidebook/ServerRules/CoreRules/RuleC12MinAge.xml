  # Core Rule 12 - Players must be and act at least 18 years old
  This is a zero tolerance rule.

  All players must be at least 18 years old. Additionally, all players must act at least as mature as a 18 year old. Admins may ban someone who they believe is acting less mature than a 18 year old, even if the player is known to be significantly older than 18 years old.

  Anyone who connects to the servers is a player, even if they don't actually play in a round.

  Anyone found to be under 18 years old will be banned permanently.

  Anyone found to have been under the age of 18 at the time of joining, but is 18 or older upon discovery, will still be banned permanently.

  There will be no appeals.
