  # Core Rule 3 - Be civil in chat
  This is a zero tolerance rule.

  Players should feel free to express their opinions, but they should be civil and not hateful.

  Players should not be deliberately inflammatory or offensive to other players, no exceptions.

  Players should be mindful of their language and avoid overusing words and terms that maybe considered offensive.

  If an admin tells you to stop overusing a word or engaging in an unconstructive topic, you must stop.

  ## Examples
  Allowed:
  - Telling someone that you are gay.
  - Infrequent use of a word that may be considered offensive, so long as it's not directed at a specific player.

  Prohibited:
  - Deliberately targeted insults or hate speech at a player, outside individual or group of people (even unrelated to the game).
  - Excessive use of words that may be considered offensive.

  ShibaStation supports the right to free speech, but we also expect players to be respectful and civil.
  Misuse of this right will result in a warning. Repeated offenses will result in a ban.
